.. intro-start

``siibra`` is a Python client for working with brain atlas frameworks
that integrate multiple brain parcellations and reference spaces across
different spatial scales, and connect them with a multimodal regional
data features. It aims to facilitate the programmatic and reproducible
incorporation of brain region features from different sources into
reproducible neuroscience workflows.

    **Note:** *``siibra-python`` is still in development. While care is taken that it works reliably, its API is not yet stable and you may still encounter bugs when using it.*

``siibra`` provides structured acccess to parcellation schemes in
different brain reference spaces, including volumetric reference
templates at both macroscopic and microscopic resolutions as well as
surface representations. It supports both discretely labelled and
continuous (probabilistic) parcellation maps, which can be used to
assign brain regions to spatial locations and image signals, to retrieve
region-specific neuroscience datasets from multiple online repositories,
and to sample information from high-resolution image data. Among the
datasets anchored to brain regions are many different modalities from
in-vivo and post mortem studies, including regional information about
cell and transmitter receptor densties, structural and functional
connectivity, gene expressions, and more.

``siibra`` is mainly developed by the `Human Brain
Project <https://humanbrainproject.eu>`__ for accessing the `EBRAINS
human brain atlas <https://ebrains.eu/service/human-brain-atlas>`__. It
stores much of its contents in the `EBRAINS Knowledge
Graph <https://kg.ebrains.eu>`__, and is designed to support the
`OpenMINDS metadata
standards <https://github.com/HumanBrainProject/openMINDS_SANDS>`__. Its
functionalities include common actions known from the interactive viewer
``siibra explorer`` `hosted on
EBRAINS <https://atlases.ebrains.eu/viewer>`__. In fact, the viewer is a
good resource for exploring ``siibra``\ ’s core functionalities
interactively: Selecting different parcellations, browsing and searching
brain region hierarchies, downloading maps, identifying brain regions,
and accessing multimodal features and connectivity information
associated with brain regions. Feature queries in ``siibra`` are
parameterized by data modality and anatomical location, while the latter
could be a brain region, brain parcellation, or location in reference
space. Beyond the functionality of ``siibra-explorer``, the Python
library also supports a range of data analysis features suitable for
typical neuroscience workflows.

``siibra`` hides much of the complexity that would be required to
collect and interact with the individual paracellations,templates andd
data repositories. By encapsulating many aspects of interacting with
different maps and reference templates spaces, it also minimizes common
errors like misinterpretation of coordinates from different reference
spaces, mixing up label indices of brain regions, or utilisation of
inconsistent versions of parcellation maps. It aims to provide a safe
way of using maps defined across multiple spatial scales for
reproducible analysis.

Installation
------------

``siibra`` is available on pypi. To install the latest released version,
simply run ``pip install siibra``. In order to work with the latest
version from github, use
``pip install git+https://github.com/FZJ-INM1-BDA/siibra-python.git@main``.

There is also an image based on jupyter:scipy-notebook, which already includes ``siibra``.

.. code-block:: sh

  docker run -dit \
        -p 10000:8888 \
        --rm \
        --name siibra \
        docker-registry.ebrains.eu/siibra/siibra-python:latest

Access to EBRAINS
-----------------

``siibra`` retrieves much of its data from the `EBRAINS Knowledge
Graph <https://kg.ebrains.eu>`__, which requires authentication.
Therefore you have to provide an EBRAINS authentication token for using
all features provided by ``siibra``. Please make sure that you have a
valid EBRAINS user account by `registering to
EBRAINS <https://ebrains.eu/register/>`__. As a last step, you need to
fetch a recent token from the `authorization
endpoint <https://nexus-iam.humanbrainproject.org/v0/oauth2/authorize>`__,
and To do so, please follow these steps:

1. If you do not yet have an EBRAINS account, register
   `here <https://ebrains.eu/register>`__ to obtain one.
2. Your EBRAINS account needs to be enabled for programmatic access to
   the EBRAINS Knowledge Graph to fetch metadata. This is formal step to
   acknowledge additional terms of use, and done quickly by emailing to
   the KG team. A link and template email to do so can be found right on
   top of the `Knowledge Graph developer
   page <https://kg.humanbrainproject.eu/develop.html>`__.
3. Let siibra fetch an authentication token by using
   `siibra.fetch_ebrains_token()`. You will be asked to visit an ebrains 
   login website. Login, and accept the requested detail.

If you prefer not to use the device flow the commandline, you can
also create your token by visiting `the EBRAINS authorization endpoint
<https://nexus-iam.humanbrainproject.org/v0/oauth2/authorize>`__. Copy the
token, and either store it in the enviroment variable ``$HBP_AUTH_TOKEN`` or
pass it explicitely to ``siibra`` using ``siibra.set_ebrains_token()``. The
token is a string sequence with more than 1000 characters, usually starting
with with “ey”.

Note that as of now, you need to to steps 3 and 4 approximately every
day to perform EBRAINS data queries. However, ``siibra`` maintains a
local cache on disk, so once retrieved, your data will become usable and
accessible without refreshing the token. During 2022, step 2 will become
obsolete, and refresh times for tokens will become longer.

Documentation & Help
--------------------

``siibra-python``\ ’s documentation is hosted at
https://siibra-python.readthedocs.io. It includes a catalogue of well
documented code examples that walk you through the different concepts
and functionalities. As a new user, it is recommended to go through
these examples - they are easy and will quickly provide you with the
right code snippets that get you started. Furthermore, a set of jupyter
notebooks demonstrating concrete example usecases are maintained in the
`siibra-tutorials <https://github.com/FZJ-INM1-BDA/siibra-tutorials>`__
repository.

If you run into issues, please open a ticket on `EBRAINS
support <https://ebrains.eu/support/>`__ or directly file bugs and
feature requests on
`github <https://github.com/FZJ-INM1-BDA/siibra-python/issues>`__.
Please keep in mind that ``siibra-python`` is still in development.
While care is taken to make everything work reliably, the API of the
library is not yet stable, and the software is not yet fully tested.
