    User of this class provide critieria as a list of AttributeCollections and the Type of
    attribute collection to search for. This class will yield all instances of requested type satisfying
    all of the criteria provided.

    For preconfigured instances, the "all" logic is enforced via `all(collection_match(...))`; for live
    query instances, it falls back to the individual implementation of the LiveQuery.generate method call.

    n.b. especially for preconfigured instances, order of the criteria can affect the search efficiency.
    opt for the criteria that is most likely to return false first (e.g. for feature, Modality)
