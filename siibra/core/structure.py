Abstract base class for any kind of brain structure.
A brain structure is more general than a brain region. It refers to any object
defining a spatial extent in one or more reference spaces, and can thus be
used to compute intersections with other structures in space. For example,
a brain region is a structure which is at the same time an AtlasConcept. A
bounding box in MNI space is a structure, but not an AtlasConcept.
