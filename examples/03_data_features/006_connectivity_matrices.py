Connectivity matrices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`siibra` provides access to parcellation-averaged connectivity matrices.
Several types of connectivity are supported.
As of now, these include "StreamlineCounts", "StreamlineLengths", and "FunctionalConnectivity".

# %%
from nilearn import plotting
import siibra
import numpy as np


# %%
# We start by selecting an atlas parcellation.
jubrain = siibra.parcellations.get("julich 2.9")

# %%
# The matrices are queried as expected, using `siibra.get_features`,
# passing the parcellation as a concept.
# Here, we query for structural connectivity matrices.
features = siibra.get_features(jubrain, siibra.modalities.StreamlineCounts)
print(f"Found {len(features)} streamline count matrices.")

# %%
# We fetch the first result, which is a specific `StreamlineCounts` object
# expressing structural connectivity in the form of numbers of streamlines 
# connecting pairs of brain regions as estimated from tractography on diffusion imaging.
# Typically, connectivity features provide a range of region-to-region
# connectivity matrices for different subjects from an imaging cohort.
conn = features[0]
print(f"Connectivity features reflects {conn.modality} of {conn.cohort} cohort.")
print(conn.name)
print("\n" + conn.description)

## Subjects are encoded via anonymized ids:
print(conn.subjects)


# %%
# The connectivity matrices are provided as pandas DataFrames,
# with region objects as index.
subject = conn.subjects[0]
matrix = conn.get_matrix(subject)
matrix

# %%
# We can create a 3D visualization of the connectivity using
# the plotting module of `nilearn <https://nilearn.github.io>`_.
# To do so, we need to provide centroids in
# the anatomical space for each region (or "node") of the connectivity matrix.
# This requires is to 1) compute centroids, and 2) organize the centroids
# in the sequence of connectivity matrix rows.
#
# We start by computing the centroids for each region
# in the matrix as defined by its mask in MNI152 space.
# Note that we need to transform the centroids from voxels into 
# physical space, using the affine matrix stored in the mask.
node_coords = [
    tuple(region.centroids('mni152')[0])
    for region in matrix.index
]

# %%
# Now we can plot the structural connectome.
