Connectivity matrices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`siibra` provides access to connectivity matrices from different sources containing averaged connectivity information for brain parcellations.
These matrices are modelled as ParcellationFeature types, so they match against a complete parcellation.
Several types of connectivity are supported.
As of now, these include the feature modalities "StreamlineCounts", "StreamlineLengths", and "FunctionalConnectivity".

# We start by selecting an atlas parcellation.
atlas = siibra.atlases.MULTILEVEL_HUMAN_ATLAS
jubrain = atlas.get_parcellation("julich 2.9")

# %%
# The matrices are queried as expected, using `siibra.get_features`, and passing the parcellation as a concept.
# Here, we query for structural connectivity matrices.
features = siibra.get_features(jubrain, siibra.modalities.StreamlineCounts)
print(f"Found {len(features)} streamline count matrices.")

# %%
# We fetch the first result and have a look at it.
# It is a specific `StreamlineCounts` object, but it is derived from the more general `ConnectivityMatrix` class.
# The `src_info` attribute contains more detailed metadata information about each matrix.

# Connectivity matrix objects provide a pandas DataFrame for the connectivity measures,
# with full region objects as index.

# %%
# We can create a 3D visualization of the connectivity using
# the plotting module of `nilearn <https://nilearn.github.io>`_.
# To do so, we need to provide centroids in
# the anatomical space for each region (or "node") of the connectivity matrix.
# This requires is to 1) compute centroids, and 2) organize the centroids
# in the sequence of connectivity matrix rows.
#
# We start by computing the centroids for each region in the parcellation map in MNI152 space.
parcmap = jubrain.get_map(space="mni152")

# %%
# The centroids are a dictionary by region object, and each centroid is a proper siibra.Point object.
# We look at the first pair.
region, centroid = next(iter(centroids.items()))

# %%
# We extract a list of coordinate tuples by
# decoding each connectivity matrix region into the corresponding region of the parcellation map,
# and then fetching the coordinate tuple of its corresponding centroid.
node_coords = [tuple(centroids[parcmap.get_region(r)]) for r in conn.matrix.index]

# Now we can plot the structural connectome.
