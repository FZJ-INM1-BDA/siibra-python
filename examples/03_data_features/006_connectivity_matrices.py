Connectivity matrices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`siibra` provides access to parcellation-averaged connectivity matrices.
Several types of connectivity are supported. As of now, these include
"StreamlineCounts", "StreamlineLengths", "FunctionalConnectivity", and
"AnatomoFunctionalConnectivity" (F-Tract).

# We start by selecting an atlas parcellation.
julich_brain = siibra.parcellations.get("julich 2.9")

# %%
# The matrices are queried as expected, using `siibra.features.get`, passing
# the parcellation as a concept. Here, we query for structural connectivity matrices.
# Since a single query may yield hundreds of connectivity matrices for different
# subjects of a cohort, siibra groups them as elements into
# :ref:`sphx_glr_examples_03_data_features_009_compound_features.py`.
# Let us select "HCP" cohort.

# We can select a specific element by integer index
print(cf[0].name)
print(cf[0].subject)  # Subjects are encoded via anonymized ids

# %%
# The connectivity matrices are provided as pandas DataFrames, with region
# objects as indices and columns. We can access the matrix corresponding to
# the selected index by
matrix = cf[0].data
matrix.iloc[0:15, 0:15]  # let us see the first 15x15

# %%
# We can create a 3D visualization of the connectivity using
# the plotting module of `nilearn <https://nilearn.github.io>`_.
# To do so, we need to provide centroids in
# the anatomical space for each region (or "node") of the connectivity matrix.
