Comparative analysis of brain organisation in two brain regions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


`siibra` data features simplify analysis of multimodal aspects of brain regions.
In this example, we select a region from the Broca region in the inferior frontal gyrus, IFG 44,
involved in language processing, and a region from the visual system in the occipital cortex, V1.

# We start by selecting the two region objects from the parcellation,
# using simple keyword specifications.
specs = ['ifg 44', 'hoc1']
regions = [siibra.get_region('julich 2.9', spec) for spec in specs]

# %%
# Next, we choose a set of feature modalities that we're interested in.
# We start with "fingerprint" style features for cell and receptor densities,
# which provide average measurements across multiple
# samples, and can be easily compared visually.

    siibra.features.molecular.ReceptorDensityFingerprint,

# We iterate the regions and modalities to generate a grid plot.

# For the same measurement types, we can also sample individual cortical profiles,
# showing density distributions from the pial surface to the gray/white matter
# boundary in individual tissue samples. Cortical profile queries result in
# CompoundFeatures with profiles as elements and each element differ according
# to the modality. So we supply an additional filter to each: a receptor name
# for ReceptorDensityProfile, section and patch numbers for CellDensityProfile,
# and a point for BigBrainIntensityProfile.

# The indices are accessible through `indices` property of compound features
