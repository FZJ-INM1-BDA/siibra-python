Comparative analysis of brain organisation in two brain regions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


`siibra` data features simplify analysis of multimodal aspects of brain regions.
In this example, we select a region from the Broca region in the inferior frontal gyrus, IFG 44,
involved in language processing, and a region from the visual system in the occipital cortex, V1.

# Next, we choose a set of feature modalities that we're interested in.
# We start with "fingerprint" style features for cell and receptor densities,
# which provide average measurements across multiple
# samples, and can be easily compared visually.
