Gene expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``siibra`` can query gene expression data from the Allen brain atlas. The gene
expressions are linked to atlas regions by coordinates of their probes in MNI
space. When querying feature by a region,  ``siibra`` automatically builds a
region mask to filter the probes.

.. hint::
    This feature is used by the `JuGEx toolbox
    <https://github.com/FZJ-INM1-BDA/siibra-jugex>`_, which provides an
    implementation for differential gene expression analysis between two
    different brain regions as proposed by Bludau et al.
