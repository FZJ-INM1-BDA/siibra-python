Parcellation-based functional data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`siibra` provides access to parcellation-averaged functional data such as
blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals.

import siibra
# sphinx_gallery_thumbnail_number = 1

# %%
# We start by selecting an atlas parcellation.
julich_brain = siibra.parcellations.get("julich 2.9")

# %%
# The tables are queried as expected, using `siibra.features.get`, passing
# the parcellation as a concept. Here, we query for regional BOLD signals.
# Since a single query may yield hundreds of signal tables for different
# subjects of a cohort and paradigms, siibra groups them as elements into
# :ref:`CompoundFeatures<compoundfeatures>`. Let us select "rfMRI_REST1_LR_BOLD"
# paradigm.
features = siibra.features.get(julich_brain, siibra.features.functional.RegionalBOLD)

        print(f"Selected: {cf.name}'\n'" + cf.description)

# %%
# We can select a specific element by integer index
print(cf[0].name)

# The signal data is provided as pandas DataFrames with region objects as
# columns and indices as as a timeseries.

# We can visualize the signal strength per region by time via a carpet plot.
# In fact, `plot_carpet` method can take a list of regions to display the
# data for selected regions only.
