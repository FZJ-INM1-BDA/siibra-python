Parcellation-based functional data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`siibra` provides access to parcellation-averaged functional data such as
blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals.

# sphinx_gallery_thumbnail_number = 1

# %%
# We start by selecting an atlas parcellation.
jubrain = siibra.parcellations.get("julich 2.9")

# %%
# The matrices are queried as expected, using `siibra.features.get`,
# passing the parcellation as a concept.
# Here, we query for structural connectivity matrices.
features = siibra.features.get(jubrain, siibra.features.functional.RegionalBOLD)
print(f"Found {len(features)} parcellation-based BOLD signals for {jubrain}.")

# %%
# We fetch the first result, which is a specific `RegionalBOLD` object.
bold = features[0]
print(f"RegionalBOLD features reflects {bold.modality} of {bold.cohort} cohort.")
print(bold.name)
print("\n" + bold.description)

# Subjects are encoded via anonymized ids:
print(bold.subjects)


# %%
# The parcellation-based functional data are provided as pandas DataFrames
# with region objects as columns and indices as time step.
subject = bold.subjects[0]
table = bold.get_table(subject)
print(f"Timestep: {bold.timestep}")
table[jubrain.get_region("hOc3v left")]


# %%
# Alternatively, we can visualize the mean signal strength per region:
bold.plot(subject=bold.subjects[0], regions=bold.regions[:15])
