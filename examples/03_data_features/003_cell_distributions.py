Cortical cell body distributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another regional data feature are cortical distributions of cell bodies. The distributions are measured crom cortical image patches that have been extracted from the original cell-body stained histological sections of the Bigbrain (Amunts et al., 2013), scanned at 1 micrometer resolution. These patches come together with manual annotations of cortical layers. The cell segmentations have been performed using the recently proposed Contour Proposal Networks (CPN; E. Upschulte et al.; https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03393; https://github.com/FZJ-INM1-BDA/celldetection).

features[0].plot()

# The segmented cells are stored in each feature as a numpy array with named columns.
# For example, to plot the 2D distribution of the cell locations colored by
# layers, we can do:
c = features[0].cells
plt.scatter(c["x"], c["y"], c=c["layer"], s=0.2)
plt.title(f"Cell distributions in {v1.name}")
plt.grid(True)
plt.axis("equal")
plt.tight_layout()

# %%
# The features also have location information. We can plot their location in
# BigBrain space:
location = features[0].anchor.location
location

# fetch the template of the location's space
template = location.space.get_template().fetch()
view = plotting.plot_anat(anat_img=template, cut_coords=tuple(location))
view.add_markers([tuple(location)])
