Cortical cell body distributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another regional data feature are cortical distributions of cell bodies.
The distributions are measured crom cortical image patches that have been extracted
from the original cell-body stained histological sections of the Bigbrain (Amunts et al., 2013),
scanned at 1 micrometer resolution. These patches come together with manual annotations of cortical layers.
The cell segmentations have been performed using the recently proposed Contour Proposal Networks (CPN; E. Upschulte et al.;
https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03393; https://github.com/FZJ-INM1-BDA/celldetection).

# We can, for example, plot the 2D distribution of the cell locations colored by layers:
plt.scatter(c.x, c.y, c=c.layer, s=0.2)
plt.title(f"Cell distributions in {v1.name}")
plt.grid(True)

# Having the data in data frame format allows further flexibility such as:
layer1_cells = c.query('layer == 1')
plt.scatter(
    layer1_cells.x, layer1_cells.y,
    s=layer1_cells["area(micron**2)"], c=layer1_cells.label
)
area_layer1 = layer1_cells["area(micron**2)"]
plt.title(f"Mean cell area in layer 1: {area_layer1.mean()}")

# %%
# The features also have location information. We can plot their location in
# BigBrain space:
location = cf[0].anchor.location
print(location)

# fetch the template of the location's space
template = location.space.get_template().fetch()
view = plotting.plot_anat(anat_img=template, cut_coords=tuple(location))
