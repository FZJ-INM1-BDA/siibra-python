Anatomical assignment
---------------------

Parcellation maps in ``siiba`` provide the possibility to assign brain regions to coordinates and image signals.
This is particularly interesting for comparing uncertaint point locations and modes from activation maps against probability maps.
A probabilistic assignment will then return for each location or mode a list of matching brain regions with different similarity scores.
