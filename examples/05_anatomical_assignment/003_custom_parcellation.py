Using a custom parcellation map to do approximate feature queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes you might want to use a custom parcellation map to perform feature queries in siibra.
This brings some challenges as we will see.
For this example, we retrieve a freely available von Economo map in MNI space from Martijn van den Heuvel's lab.
"""


# %%
import siibra
import re  # we need this for text file parsing below
from nilearn import plotting

# %%
# Load the custom parcellation map from the online resource.
# For the retrieval, siibra's zipfile connector is very helpful.
# We can use the resulting NIfTI to create a custom parcellation map inside siibra.

# connect to the online zip file
conn = siibra.retrieval.ZipfileConnector(
    "http://www.dutchconnectomelab.nl/economo/economoMNI152volume.zip"
)

# the NIfTI file is easily retrieved:
nifti_map = conn.get("economoMNI152volume/economoMNI152volume.nii.gz")

# The text file with label mappings has a custom format.
# We provide a simple decoder to extract the list of region/label pairs.
decoder = lambda b: [
    re.split(r'\s+', line)[:2]       # fields are separated by one or more whitespaces
    for line in b.decode().split('\n')
    if re.match(r'^\d\d\d\d', line)  # only lines starting with 4-digit labels are relevant
]
labels = conn.get("economoMNI152volume/economoLUT.txt", decode_func=decoder)

# for efficiency of this example, we create the map from only the first 5 regions
labels = labels[:6]

# Now we use this to add a custom map to siibra.
# Note that this assumes our external knowledge that the map is in MNI152 space.
custom_map = siibra.add_nifti_map(
    name="Von Economo Atlas",
    nifti_map=nifti_map,
    space_spec='mni152',
    regionnames=[name for label, name in labels],
    regionlabels=[int(label) for label, name in labels]
)

# let's plot the final map
plotting.plot_roi(custom_map.fetch())


# %%
# We can already use this map to find spatial features, such as BigBrain intensity profiles.
profiles = siibra.features.get(
    custom_map.parcellation.get_region('fcbm'),
    siibra.features.cellular.BigBrainIntensityProfile
)
print(f"{len(profiles)} intensity profiles found.")

# However, we will not find any feature that were linked to brain regions instead of coordinate-based locations.
# This is beccause siibra does not know about the relationships of the custom parcellation's region
# and its preconfigured parcellations.
fingerprints = siibra.features.get(
    custom_map.parcellation.get_region('fcbm'),
    siibra.features.molecular.ReceptorDensityFingerprint
)
print(f"{len(fingerprints)} receptor fingerprints found.")

# %%
# To overcome this, we can compute relationships of the custom parcellation 
# to a know parcellation, based on probabilistic assignmet of the different parcels. 
# Let's do that with the Julich-Brain cytoarchitectonic maps. 
custom_map.compute_relations('julich 2.9')

# Now, the system has discovered relationships with known regions
custom_region = custom_map.parcellation.get_region('fcbm')
print(custom_region.related_regions)

# %%
# After this step, we find receptor fingerprints when executing the same call.
# The 'last_match' attribute of each feature explains why.
fingerprints = siibra.features.get(
    custom_map.parcellation.get_region('fcbm'),
    siibra.features.molecular.ReceptorDensityFingerprint
)
print(f"{len(fingerprints)} receptor fingerprints found.")
fp=fingerprints[0]
print(f"Found related feature: {fp.name}.\n{fp.last_match_description}\n")
