Assigning coordinates to brain regions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`siibra` can use statistical parcellations maps to make a probabilistic
assignment of exact and imprecise coordinates to brain regions. We start by
selecting the Julich-Brain probabilistic maps from the human atlas, which we
will use for the assignment.

# **Assigning exact coordinate specifications.**
# We now determine the probability values of cytoarchitectonic regions at a an
# arbitrary point in MNI reference space. The example point is manually chosen.
# It should be located in PostCG of the right hemisphere. For more information
# about the ``siibra.Point`` class see :ref:`locations`. The output is a pandas
# dataframe, which includes the values of different probability maps at the
# given location. We can sort the table by these values, to see that the region
# with highest probability is indeed the expected region.

# %%
# **Assigning coordinate specifications with location uncertainty.**
# Typically, coordinate specifications are not exact. For example, we obtain a
# position from an sEEG electrode, which has several millimeters of uncertainty
# (especially after warping it to standard space!). If we specify the position
# with a location uncertainty, ``siibra`` will not just read out the values of
# the probability maps, but instead generate a 3D Gaussian blob with a
# corresponding standard deviation, and correlate the 3D blob with the maps. We
# then obtain the weighted average of the map values over the blob, but also
# additional measures of comparison: A correlation coefficient, the intersection
# over union (IoU), a containedness score of the blob wrt. the region
# ("contained"), and a containness score of the region wrt. the blob
# ("contains"). Per default, the resulting table is sorted by correlation
# coefficient. Here, we query the assignments with a containedness score of at
# least 0.5, that is, the regions in which the uncertain point is likely
# contained.
