Utilizing locations of interest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`siibra` provides common locations of interests on reference spaces as objects.
These location objects can be used to query features or assignment to the maps,
see :ref:`sphx_glr_examples_05_anatomical_assignment_001_coordinates.py` and
:ref:`sphx_glr_examples_05_anatomical_assignment_002_activation_maps.py`.
The conversion of these locations to other spaces are done in the background
but one can also be invoked when needed.

# The simplest location type is a point. It can have a uncertainty variable
# or can be exact.

# We can create a PointSet from several points or a set of coordinates.

# There are several helper properties and methods for locations, some specific
# to the location type. For example, we can warp the points to another space
# (currently limited only between MNI152, COLIN27, and BigBrain).
print(point.warp('bigbrain'))
