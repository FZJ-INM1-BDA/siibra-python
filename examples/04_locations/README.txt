Locations in reference spaces
-----------------------------

``siibra`` supports defining several types of locations in reference spaces for the analysis
of point or region of interests. Using the location objects, you can query for features
and employ their utility functions for detailed analysis. Additionally, ``siibra`` supports
warping coordinates between most popular spaces to enable users to study these locations of
interests in different spaces and parcellation maps.
