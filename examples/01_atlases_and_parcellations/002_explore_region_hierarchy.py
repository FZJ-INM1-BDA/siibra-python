Explore brain region hierarchies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each parcellation is the root element of a tree of brain regions.
In fact, Parcellation objects are special Region objects, so they
inherit all functionalities of a region, while providing additional
capabilities such as access to parcellation maps.
Other then "standard" Region objects, parcellations do not have a
parent region.

# %%
# We start by selecting an atlas and a parcellation
import siibra
atlas = siibra.atlases.get('human')
julich_brain = atlas.parcellations.get('julich 2.9')
julich_brain
# sphinx_gallery_thumbnail_path = '_static/example_thumbnails/01-002.png'

# %%
# The region hierarchy is a tree structure. Its default representation is a
# string of the tree.
julich_brain.render_tree()

# %%
# Each node is a `Region` object, including the root node.
# We can iterate all regions in a parcellation
[region.name for region in julich_brain]

# %%
# We can iterate the brain divisions in the parcellation
[region.name for region in julich_brain.children]

# %%
# We can also iterate only the leaves of the tree
[region.name for region in julich_brain.leaves]
