Spatial properties of brain regions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a reference space is specified, brain regions can expose a range of
spatial properties.
"""

# %%
# We start by selecting an atlas and a space
import siibra
atlas = siibra.atlases.get("human")
# print the spaces defined in the atlas
print(atlas.spaces)

# %%
# Choose a space
space = atlas.spaces.get("icbm 2009c asym")
print(space.name)
# and a region
v1_left = atlas.get_region("v1 left", parcellation='julich 2.9')
print(v1_left)

# %%
# The `Region.spatial_props()` method computes the centroid and volume of a
# brain region.  Note that a brain region
# might in general consist of multiple separated components in the space.
# Also note that in `siibra`, spatial properties are always represented in
# millimeter units of the physical coordinate system of the reference space,
# not in voxel units.
from pprint import pprint
props = v1_left.spatial_props(space=space)
pprint(props)

# %%
# The returned centroid is `siibra.Point` object. Such spatial primitives are
# covered in more detail in :ref:`locations`. For now, we just acknowledge
# that this minimizes misinterpretation of the coordinates, since a siibra
# Point is explicitly linked to its space.
centroid = props.components[0].centroid
print(centroid)
centroid.space.name

# %%
# We can also generate a binary mask of the region in a given space and maptype, which
# gives us a Nifti1Image object as provided by `nibabel <https://nipy.org/nibabel/>`_, 
# and which we can directly visualize using plotting functions like the ones in 
# `nilearn <https://nilearn.github.io/stable/index.html>`_:
mask = v1_left.get_regional_map(space, maptype="labelled")
from nilearn import plotting
plotting.plot_roi(mask.fetch(), title=f"Mask of {v1_left.name} in {space.name}")
