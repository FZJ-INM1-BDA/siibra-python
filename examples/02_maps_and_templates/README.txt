.. _parcmaps:

Maps and templates
------------------

Reference spaces and parcellations have spatial representations in specific coordinate systems, in the form of image volumes or meshes defined in brain reference space. 
This includes in particular brain reference templates, discrete parcellation maps, probabilistic parcellation maps, or region masks. 
These spatial objects are always explicitly linked to a unique brain reference space. 
As shown in the previous examples, ``siibra`` supports a range of different reference spaces, including the MNI space for the human brain but also the BigBrain histological space and the freesurfer surface. 
Therefore, some brain parcellations and regions have maps in different spaces associated to them.
