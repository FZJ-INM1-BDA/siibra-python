Access parcellation maps in surface space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``siibra`` also provides basic access to surfaces. 
A popular reference space for the human brain is the freesurfer fsaverage surface.
It comes in three variants: white matter surface, pial surface, and inflated surface.
Each is shipped with left and right hemispheres separately.
"""

# %%
# For plotting meshes, most python libraries can be employed.
# We recommend the plotting module of `nilearn <https://nilearn.github.io>`_.
import siibra
from nilearn import plotting

# %%
# Load the Julich-Brain parcellation.
jubrain = siibra.parcellations["julich"]

# %%
# We can tell volumetric from surface spaces using their `is_surface` attribute.
for space in jubrain.spaces:
    if space.provides_mesh:
        print(space)

# %%
# The surface map is accessed using the `get map` method where we specify the space. Note that
# we call the method here on the parcellation object, while previous examples usually called it
# on an atlas object.
mp = jubrain.get_map(space='fsaverage6')

# %%
# For surfaces, the `fetch()` method accepts an additional parameter 'variant'. If not specified,
# siibra displays the possible options as a list fetches the first one from the list.
# Now let us fetch a specific variant and also the hemisphere fragment
mesh = mp.fetch(variant="inflated", fragment="left")

# The returned structure is a dictionary of three numpy arrays representing the vertices, faces, and labels respectively. 
# Each vertex defines a 3D surface point, while the faces are triplets of indices into the list of vertices, defining surface triangles.
# The labels provide the label index associated with each vertex.
print(mesh.keys())

# %%
# Most meshes are shipped with a color map which we can fetch from the map object by 
jubrain_cmap = mp.get_colormap()

# Now we can plot the mesh
plotting.view_surf(
    surf_mesh=[mesh['verts'], mesh['faces']],
    surf_map=mesh['labels'],
    cmap=jubrain_cmap, symmetric_cmap=False, colorbar=False
)
