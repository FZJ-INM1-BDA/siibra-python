Access parcellation maps in surface space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``siibra`` also provides basic access to surfaces. A popular reference space
for the human brain is the freesurfer fsaverage surface. It comes in three
variants: white matter surface, pial surface, and inflated surface. Each is
shipped with left and right hemispheres separately.
"""

# %%
# For plotting meshes, most python libraries can be employed.
# We recommend the plotting module of `nilearn <https://nilearn.github.io>`_.
import siibra
from nilearn import plotting
# sphinx_gallery_thumbnail_path = '_static/example_thumbnails/02-005.png'

# %%
# Load the Julich-Brain parcellation.
julich_brain = siibra.parcellations.get("julich 2.9")

# %%
# We can tell volumetric from surface spaces using their `is_surface` attribute.
for space in julich_brain.spaces:
    if space.provides_mesh:
        print(space)

# %%
# The surface map is accessed using the `get map` method where we specify the
# space. Note that we call the method here on the parcellation object, while
# previous examples usually called it on an atlas object.
mp = julich_brain.get_map(space='fsaverage6')

# %%
# For surfaces, the `fetch()` method accepts an additional parameter 'variant'.
# If not specified, siibra displays the possible options as a list fetches the
# first one from the list. Now let us fetch a specific variant and also the
# hemisphere fragment
mesh = mp.fetch(variant="inflated", fragment="left")
mesh
# The returned structure is a Surface consiting of three numpy arrays representing the
# vertices, faces, and vertex_labels respectively. Each vertex defines a 3D surface
# point, while the faces are triplets of indices into the list of vertices,
# defining surface triangles. The labels provide the label index associated with
# each vertex.

# %%
# Most meshes are shipped with a color map which we can fetch from the map
# object by
julich_brain_cmap = mp.get_colormap()

# Now we can plot the mesh
