Atlases
-------

Atlases are the most high-level concepts in ``siibra``. 
They provide a common context for a  collection of parcellations and reference spaces of the same species, which are integrated with each other through semantic and spatial links. Atlas objects also provide many convenient shortcuts for using functionalities of their parcellations, parcellation maps and spaces.
