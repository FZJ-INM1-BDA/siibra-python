Connectivity matrices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`siibra` provides access to parcellation-averaged connectivity matrices.
Several types of connectivity are supported. As of now, these include
"StreamlineCounts", "StreamlineLengths", "FunctionalConnectivity", and
"AnatomoFunctionalConnectivity" (F-Tract).

# The matrices are queried as expected, using `siibra.features.get`, passing

# Since a single query may yield hundreds of connectivity matrices for different
# subjects of a cohort, siibra groups them as elements into
# :ref:`sphx_glr_examples_03_data_features_009_compound_features.py`.
# Let us select "HCP" cohort.
