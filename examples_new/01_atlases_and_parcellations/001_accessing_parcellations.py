Selecting preconfigured parcellations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just as for atlas objects, `siibra` provides an instance table of preconfigured
brain parcellations.
"""

# %%
# We start by loading the library
import siibra

# sphinx_gallery_thumbnail_path = '_static/example_thumbnails/default_thumbnail.png'
# %%
# The instance table can list the keys of all parcellations predefined in `siibra`.
# Note that this includes parcellations for all supported atlases.
siibra.parcellations.keys

# %%
# Fetching an object works in the same way as for `siibra.atlases` (see :ref:`atlases`)
julich_brain = siibra.parcellations.get("julich")

# %%
# Parcellations typically refer to entities in the EBRAINS knowledge graph,
# modelled in the MINDS and openMINDS standards. `siibra` stores their
# identifiers. Note that this holds for spaces and other concepts as well, as
# will be seen in the next examples.
print(julich_brain.ID)

# %%
# Also, you can display the doi/url of the related dataset/publication using
print(julich_brain.publications)

# %%
# The resulting parcellation is a semantic object, including
#
# - general information like the parcellation name, a description and related publications
# - the region hierarchy
# - functions to access parcellation maps in different reference spaces
# - functions to find and access regions and region masks
#
# Parcellation maps and brain  regions are covered in the next examples. For now let's
# just look at a few metadata fields:
print("Name:    ", julich_brain.name)
print("Id:      ", julich_brain.ID)
print("Modality:", julich_brain.modalities)
print()
for p in julich_brain.publications:
    print(f"[{p.value}]({p.text})")
