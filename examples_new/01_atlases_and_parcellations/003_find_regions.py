Find brain regions in a parcellation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can use Parcellation objects to find child brain regions.
"""

# %%
# We start by selecting an atlas and a parcellation.
import siibra
julich_brain = siibra.parcellations.get('julich 2.9')
# sphinx_gallery_thumbnail_path = '_static/example_thumbnails/01-003.png'

# %%
# The most basic way is to search for all regions matching a particular string:
julich_brain.find('V1')

# %%
# For more powerful searches, regular expressions can be used with
# '/<pattern>/<flags>' or  using `re.compile()`. Find hOc2 or hOc4 in the right
# hemisphere:
julich_brain.find('/hOc[24].*right/')

# %%
# Searching for more general brain regions, we see that areas often appear
# three times: Julich-Brain defines them separately for the left and right
# hemisphere, and additionally defines a common parent region.
for r in julich_brain.find('amygdala'):
    print(r.name)

# %%
# siibra provides a package-level function
# to search through regions of all parcellations.
siibra.find_regions('amygdala')

# %%
# Often however, we want to access one particular region, given a unique specification,
# and not obtain a list of many possible matches. This can be done using the
# `get_region` method. It assumes that the provided region specification is
# unique, and returns the single exact match.
# Note that if the specification is not unique, this method will raise an exception!
julich_brain.get_region('v1 left')

# %%
# siibra provides a package-level shortcut function for this as well:
siibra.get_region('julich 2.9', 'v1 left')

# %%
# In case that the given specification matches multiple regions, which however represent
# the children of the same parent, `get_region` will return the parent object.
# In that case, the returned region can be a full subtree:
julich_brain.get_region('amygdala')
